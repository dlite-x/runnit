# Ship Management Guide

## Overview
Ships are the key to expanding your interplanetary civilization. They enable colonization of new planets and transportation of resources between worlds.

## Ship Types

### Colony Ship
- **Purpose**: Colonize uninhabited planets (Mars, Moon)
- **Cost**: 10 metal + 5 fuel
- **Capacity**: Carries colonists to establish new settlements
- **One-time use**: Consumed upon successful colonization

### Cargo Ship
- **Purpose**: Transport resources between planets
- **Cost**: 5 metal + 3 fuel
- **Cargo Capacity**: Can load/unload food, fuel, metal, and power
- **Reusable**: Can make multiple trips

## Building Ships

- **Location**: Ships can **only be built on Earth**
- **Requirements**: 
  - Sufficient metal and fuel resources
  - Space Station must be built first
- Ships are built at your Earth space station and start with 0 fuel

## Flight Control Panel

Access the Flight Control Panel via the "Solar System Flight Control" button to manage all your ships.

### Ship Information Display
Each ship shows:
- **Name**: Ship identifier (e.g., Colony Ship 1)
- **Type**: Colony or Cargo
- **Location**: Current planet
- **Destination**: Target planet (click to change)
- **Fuel**: Current fuel / Required fuel for destination
- **Cargo**: Resources loaded (cargo ships only)
- **ETA**: Estimated time of arrival (when in transit)
- **Status**: Docked, Ready, In Transit, or Needs Fuel

### Setting Destinations
1. Click on the destination cell for your ship
2. Select from available planets: Earth, Mars, Moon
3. Fuel requirements update automatically based on distance

### Refueling Ships
- Click the fuel icon (‚õΩ) to top up fuel
- Fuel is drawn from your current planet's fuel reserves
- Fuel is added incrementally based on available resources
- Cost: 1 fuel resource per unit

### Managing Cargo (Cargo Ships Only)
1. Click "Load/Unload" button
2. Modal opens showing current cargo and planet resources
3. Adjust sliders to load or unload:
   - **Food**
   - **Fuel**
   - **Metal**
   - **Power**
4. Click "Confirm" to apply changes
5. Resources are immediately transferred to/from ship

### Launching Ships
1. Ensure ship has sufficient fuel for the journey
2. Ship status must show "Ready to Launch"
3. Click "Launch" button
4. Ship enters transit and travels to destination
5. Monitor ETA for arrival time

## Travel Guide

Click the rocket icon (üöÄ) in the top-right corner to open the Travel Guide.

### Understanding the Matrix
- **Rows**: Origin planet (where you're traveling from)
- **Columns**: Destination planet (where you're going to)
- **Each Cell Shows**:
  - ‚õΩ Fuel cost for the journey
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Travel time duration

### Fuel Requirements
- Earth ‚Üî Moon: 50 fuel, ~2.5 days
- Earth ‚Üî Mars: 100 fuel, ~5 days
- Moon ‚Üî Mars: 75 fuel, ~3.75 days

## Best Practices

### Colonization Strategy
1. Build a Colony Ship on Earth
2. Set destination to Mars or Moon
3. Top up fuel to 100% of requirement
4. Launch when ready
5. Ship automatically colonizes upon arrival

### Resource Transport
1. Build Cargo Ships for regular supply runs
2. Load resources at origin planet
3. Ensure sufficient fuel for round trip
4. Launch and wait for arrival
5. Unload cargo at destination
6. Refuel and return or continue to next destination

### Fleet Management
- Build multiple cargo ships for efficient resource distribution
- Keep ships fueled and ready for emergencies
- Monitor ETAs to coordinate arrivals
- Use the Travel Guide to plan efficient routes

## Tips
- **Plan ahead**: Check fuel requirements before building ships
- **Resource balance**: Ensure you have enough fuel production to support fleet operations
- **Strategic positioning**: Keep cargo ships at key locations for quick response
- **Colonize early**: Establishing Mars/Moon bases enables local resource production and reduces transport needs
