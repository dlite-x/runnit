# Ship Management Guide

## Overview
Ships are the key to expanding your interplanetary civilization. They enable colonization of new planets and transportation of resources between worlds.

## Ship Types

### Colony Ship
- **Purpose**: Colonize uninhabited planets (Mars, Moon)
- **Cost**: 200 credits
- **Capacity**: Carries up to 50 colonists to establish new settlements
- **Cargo**: Can transport food, fuel, and metal resources
- **One-time use**: Consumed upon successful colonization

### Cargo Ship
- **Purpose**: Transport resources between planets
- **Cost**: 200 credits
- **Cargo Capacity**: Can load/unload food, fuel, metal, and power
- **Reusable**: Can make multiple trips

### Space Station
- **Purpose**: Establish permanent orbital infrastructure at planets
- **Cost**: 500 credits
- **Capacity**: Can carry people for transport
- **Cargo**: Cannot carry cargo resources
- **Deployment**: One station per location (Earth, Moon, Mars only - not EML1)
- **One-time use**: Consumed upon deployment, becomes permanent orbiting structure

## Building Ships

- **Location**: Ships can **only be built on Earth**
- **Requirements**: 
  - Sufficient credits (200 for Colony/Cargo, 500 for Station)
  - Ships are built and appear in orbit around Earth
- Ships start with 0 fuel and must be refueled before launch

## Flight Control Panel

Access the Flight Control Panel via the "Solar System Flight Control" button to manage all your ships.

### Ship Information Display
Each ship shows:
- **Name**: Ship identifier (e.g., Colony Ship 1, Station 1)
- **Type**: Colony, Cargo, or Station
- **Location**: Current planet
- **Destination**: Target planet (click to change)
- **Fuel**: Current fuel / Required fuel for destination
- **Cargo**: Resources loaded (cargo ships only - stations cannot carry cargo)
- **People**: Number of people on board (colony ships and stations)
- **ETA**: Estimated time of arrival (when in transit)
- **Status**: Docked, Ready, In Transit, or Needs Fuel

### Setting Destinations
1. Click on the destination cell for your ship
2. Select from available planets:
   - **All ships**: Earth, Mars, Moon
   - **Colony ships only**: EML1 (Lagrange Point)
   - **Stations**: Cannot select EML1 as destination
3. Fuel requirements update automatically based on distance

### Refueling Ships
- Click the fuel icon (‚õΩ) to top up fuel
- Fuel is drawn from your current planet's fuel reserves
- Fuel is added incrementally based on available resources
- Cost: 1 fuel resource per unit

### Managing Cargo (Cargo Ships Only)
1. Click "Load/Unload" button (disabled for stations)
2. Modal opens showing current cargo and planet resources
3. Adjust sliders to load or unload:
   - **Food**
   - **Fuel**
   - **Metal**
4. Click "Confirm" to apply changes
5. Resources are immediately transferred to/from ship

**Note**: Space stations cannot carry cargo resources. This button is disabled for stations.

### Launching Ships
1. Ensure ship has sufficient fuel for the journey
2. Ship status must show "Ready to Launch"
3. Click "Launch" button
4. Ship enters transit and travels to destination
5. Monitor ETA for arrival time

### Deploying Stations (Stations Only)
1. Launch station to desired destination (Moon, Mars, or Earth)
2. Wait for station to arrive at destination
3. Click "Deploy" button when arrived
4. Station becomes a permanent orbiting structure at that location
5. **Restrictions**:
   - Only one station can be deployed per location
   - Cannot deploy at EML1
   - Station is consumed upon deployment

## Travel Guide

Click the rocket icon (üöÄ) in the top-right corner to open the Travel Guide.

### Understanding the Matrix
- **Rows**: Origin planet (where you're traveling from)
- **Columns**: Destination planet (where you're going to)
- **Each Cell Shows**:
  - ‚õΩ Fuel cost for the journey
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Travel time duration

### Fuel Requirements
- Earth ‚Üî Moon: 50 fuel, ~2.5 days
- Earth ‚Üî Mars: 100 fuel, ~5 days
- Moon ‚Üî Mars: 75 fuel, ~3.75 days

## Best Practices

### Colonization Strategy
1. Build a Colony Ship on Earth
2. Set destination to Mars, Moon, or EML1
3. Load colonists (up to 50 people)
4. Top up fuel to 100% of requirement
5. Launch when ready
6. Ship automatically colonizes upon arrival

### Station Deployment Strategy
1. Build a Space Station on Earth (costs 500 credits)
2. Set destination to Moon or Mars (not EML1)
3. Load people if transporting colonists
4. Refuel for the journey
5. Launch and wait for arrival
6. Deploy at destination to create permanent orbital infrastructure
7. Remember: Only one station per location allowed

### Resource Transport
1. Build Cargo Ships for regular supply runs
2. Load resources at origin planet
3. Ensure sufficient fuel for round trip
4. Launch and wait for arrival
5. Unload cargo at destination
6. Refuel and return or continue to next destination

### Fleet Management
- Build multiple cargo ships for efficient resource distribution
- Deploy stations strategically at key locations for infrastructure
- Keep ships fueled and ready for emergencies
- Monitor ETAs to coordinate arrivals
- Use the Travel Guide to plan efficient routes
- Remember station deployment limits (one per location)

## Tips
- **Plan ahead**: Check fuel requirements before building ships
- **Resource balance**: Ensure you have enough fuel production to support fleet operations
- **Strategic positioning**: Keep cargo ships at key locations for quick response
- **Station placement**: Deploy stations at high-traffic planets for maximum utility
- **Colonize early**: Establishing Mars/Moon bases enables local resource production and reduces transport needs
- **Budget wisely**: Stations cost more (500 credits) but provide permanent infrastructure
